<h2>🚸 JS Game - school project assignment 🚸</h2>

<h3>🧬 About 🧬</h3>
For this school assignment, which involves creating a game in JavaScript, I envisioned a game inspired by the theme of my previous Lunar Lander assignment.
This new game, titled "Pawsome Meowterspace - encounter of the Lunartic" extends the whimsical world and fantasy around a mischievous black cat named Pepper.
Working as a pair in a team, my friend @JonatanS23 and I extended this story to the game on a great level.
We are hoping that you will imerse yourself in the world of Pawsome Meowterspace and enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed forging our vision!

<h3>Pawsome Meowterspace: The Cat's First Adventure 🐱‍🚀🛸</h3>

<p>Pepper's favorite toy is a golden ball of yarn. One night, captivated by the moon's radiant glow, Pepper becomes enchanted by its shimmering presence.
To Pepper, the moon looks like a giant ball of yarn hanging in the sky, making it irresistible.
As it gazes up at the moon, an idea takes hold: it must leave Earth and reach the moon, where it can eternally play and sleep undisturbed by humans.

Driven by this dream, Pepper ingeniously constructs a spaceship. With its destination in sight, it embarks on its daring journey to space.
However, upon nearing the moon, Pepper discovers that landing is not as easy as it thought. It now seeks the player's help to safely land on the moon's surface.

In this game, the player assists Pepper in piloting its spaceship, guiding it to a safe landing on the moon so it can fulfill its
dream of endless play and rest under the moon's gentle light.</p>

<h3>Pawsome Meowterspace: encounter of the Lunartic 🛸☄🌚</h3>

<p>Building on the adventurous spirit and Pepper's curiosity and determination to explore space, the new assignment continues Pepper's story.

Having successfully landed on the moon and enjoyed its time there, Pepper decides to move on and explore further. During its journey,
Pepper encounters a deity patrolling the cosmos—a formidable asteroid known as Lunartic, determined to challenge Pepper. Lunartic attacks with comets,
and Pepper must deftly avoid them and persist until Lunartic runs out of energy.

The player helps Pepper navigate this treacherous encounter, dodging the comet attacks and eventually landing on Lunartic's surface,
conquering the celestial challenge just as it did with the moon.

In this new adventure, the player's skill and Pepper's tenacity are put to the test, as they work together to overcome cosmic obstacles
and explore the vast reaches of space.</p>
