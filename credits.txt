Additional Notes:
We want to express gratitude to specific individuals and/or organizations who provided the music used in our project.

Modification Details:
We've made some modifications to a few of the original tracks to ensure they fit seamlessly within the game environment.
Specifically, we've shortened certain sounds to ensure they play more frequently as needed in the game.
These adjustments were made to enhance the overall gaming experience and ensure that the audio complements the gameplay effectively.

Notes on Selection:
The selection of tracks for our project was carefully selected with the aim of providing players with an immersive and enjoyable
experience. Each track was chosen for its exceptional quality and its perfect alignment with the thematic elements and mood of
the game. We believe that these selected tracks not only enhance the atmosphere of the game but also contribute
significantly to the overall enjoyment of the player's experience.
